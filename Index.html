                <p> Thomas Holmes was born almost 22 years ago in South Jordan, Utah. He is the 
                second oldest of 8 kids and one of things most important values he was taught is 
                the importance of respect and effort. He recently got married and is excited to 
                start a family. He loves sports and music and has found a new
                love for computers and web design.
                </p>

                <p> After high school, Thomas worked in construction for a couple years realizing in the process that
                he wouldn't make a career out of it. After a lot of thought and consideration and known to be a perfectionist
                he thought a career in computer science would suit him well. He loves and is always willing to learn new 
                things and is hoping to aquire a web development skill set that he can use in his career.
                </p>
